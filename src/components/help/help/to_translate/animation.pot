"This is the module you will spend most of your time in when you are working "
"with <b>Tupi</b>. You know why? This is where you will build each frame of "
"your animation; every line of every character and every piece of the "
"scenario for which you want to tell the story.<br> In other words, if you "
"wanted to create an animation of a character walking down a street, this tab "
"is where you will design the character and each of the positions in which "
"it will appear as you move it."

"two ruler scales, one at the top and one the left. In the centre, there is a "

"<b>Scene Manager</b><br> What is a scene? I’ll try to give a simple "
"definition: think of a movie or a TV commercial, I’m sure you’ve noticed "
"that they’re always made up of small pieces shot separately and then "
"arranged to tell the story? These fragments are usually easily recognised by "
"changes in the position of the camera or the spectator’s point of view.<br> "
"Once this concept is clear, it’s easy to explain this component, through "
"this panel you will be able to create, modify or delete each of the scenes "
"that you include in your animation project.<br> <b>Tip:</b> It is important "

"what scenes you will develop and in what order you’re going to create them. "
