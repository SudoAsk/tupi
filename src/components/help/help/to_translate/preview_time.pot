"Okay, we have half the frames of our project completed. It's time to learn "
"to use the <i>Player Module.</i> Needless to say there is no general rule "
"about how many frames you create before making a preview of your project, "
"this is another skill that develops from practice, in other words you "
"choose."

"Additionally, note that performing a preview of your animation does not "
"affect your project at all, therefore, you can access this module as many "
"times as you want, giving you the chance to find out how comfortable you "
"feel about the end result and to fix the issues you consider awkward.<br> "
"The preview interface is quite simple, so there is nothing to worry about. "
"The <i>Control Panel</i> contains all the necessary buttons to play your "
"animation, step by step or continuously."

"If you look at the bottom of the panel, you will find information about the "
"project: <i>Name of the scene,</i> the <i>total number of frames</i> and the "
"<i>number of frames per second (FPS),</i> this last option is editable and "
"allows you to adjust the speed of your animation. The FPS value is directly "
"proportional to the speed of the animation, as bigger it is, as faster the "
"animation will be."

"Okay, now it's time to continue drawing new frames following the routemap of "

"<i>\"tweening\"</i>, used to save a lot of time when you are illustrating."
