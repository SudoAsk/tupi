<p class="paragraph">
We write a story! You do have a story, don't you? It's the first step in creating an animation project. Usually the novices usually begin to draw on the first frame of the <i>Animation Module</i>, without having even the slightest idea of what will happen in the final frame; this is definitely not a good strategy for quality results. As with any project, animation takes planning. Before you start drawing, stop and think for a moment: What is my story?
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
No matter how small your project, it is always worth investing a few minutes to think about the details of your animation, questions like: Who are the characters? What is the perspective? Where are they? Where are they going? How many scenes am I going to include? The longer your animation, you should be more careful with the answers to these questions.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
For professional animators, the result of this planning is reflected in a document known as a script, which is nothing more than a written text which tells a story so that an entire team can understand and make it a reality. In this case, it is only you but, even though you are the only one who has to understand the story, its still good practice to write out your story to organize your thoughts and prepare yourself for the future. When you think about importance of writing your script, think of the importance of plans for an architect or sheet music for a musician.

For our example, the idea that we have chosen is quite simple: we are going to create a very simple animation of a butterfly moving by the scene following a trajectory similar to the one of the following image:
</p>
<center>
<img src="../images/butterfly.png"/>
<p class="paragraph">
<b>Fig #31.</b> Trajectory of the butterfly (basic example)
</p>
</center>
<p class="paragraph">
The butterfly will appear from the left side of the screen and will disappear to the right, in a matter of a few seconds. He is everything. You are probably thinking that this is too simple-perhaps even a waste of your time, but don't forget, you need to learn how to use the tools before you can craft a masterpiece. When you have acquired great skill, we hope you'll tell show us the fruits of your labor It is important though, not to forget, as an artist, to plan your project before you start to draw.

Good, we already have ready a mini script for our example, so <a href="new.html">let's get to work!</a>
