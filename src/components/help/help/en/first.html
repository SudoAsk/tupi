    <p class="title">First things first!</p>
    <p class="paragraph"> We write a story! Do you have a story , or do
      you not have one yet? It's the first step in creating an animation
      project. Usually the novices begin to draw on the first frame of
      the <i>Animation Module,</i> without even having the slightest
      and idea of what Will Happen in the final frame, this is
      definitely not a good strategy for quality results. As with any
      project, animation takes planning. Before you start drawing, stop
      and think for a moment: What is my story?</p>
    <p class="paragraph"> No matter how small your project, it is always
      worth investing a FEW minutes to think about the details of your
      animation, questions like: Who are the characters? What is the
      perspective? Where are they? Where Are they going? How many am I
      going to scenes include? The longer your animation, you should be
      careful with the answers more to these questions. </p>
    <p class="paragraph"> For professional animators, the result of this
      planning document is reflected in a known as a script, which is
      nothing more than a written text that tells a story so which an
      entire team can understand and make it a reality. In this case, it
      is only you but, even though you are the only one who has to
      understand the story, it's still good practice to write out your
      story to organize and prepare yourself and your thoughts for the
      future. When you think about your script's importance, think of
      the importance of plans for an architect or sheet music for a
      musician.</p>
    <p class="paragraph"> For our example, the idea is that we have
      CHOSEN remove simple: we are going to create a very simple
      animation of a butterfly moving by the scene Following a
      trajectory similar to the one of the following image: </p>
    <center> <img src="../images/butterfly.png">
      <p class="paragraph"> <b>Fig #31.</b> Trajectory of the
        butterfly (basic example) </p>
    </center>
    <p class="paragraph"> The butterfly will Appear from the left side
      of the screen and disappear to the right, in a matter of a FEW
      seconds. He is everything. Probably you are thinking this is too
      simple that, perhaps even a waste of your time, but do not forget,
      you need to learn how to use the tools before you craft a
      masterpiece dog. When you have great skill acquired, we hope
      you'll tell us the fruits show of your work It is important
      though, not to forget, as an artist, to plan your project before
      you start to draw. <br>
      <br>
      Good, we already have ready a mini script for our example, so <a
