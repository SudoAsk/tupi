<p class="title">Let's start a project</p>
<p class="paragraph">Okay, it's time to open <b>Tupi</b> first.
Independent of the graphical environment in which you are working,
if you already have the program installed on your computer, you
should look in the section <i>"Graphics"</i> in your main
application menu:</p>

<p class="paragraph"><b>Fig # 32.</b> Opening <b>Tupi</b> from
Ubuntu</p>
</center>
<p class="paragraph">Once open, you'll see a screen like this on
your computer:</p>

<p class="paragraph"><b>Fig # 33.</b> Home Screen</p>
</center>
<p class="paragraph">At this point, you have two options: Create a
new project or open an existing one. As this is our first time, we
will create a new project by clicking on the icon again:</p>

<p class="paragraph"><b>Fig # 34.</b> Creating a new project</p>
</center>
<p class="paragraph">On the dialog box that appears, you will enter
basic information about the project: a file name, author's name,
the dimension we want to give our animation and the number of
frames per second (FPS) with which want to work initially.<br>
For this example, we will simply fill the first two fields and
leave others with their default values:</p>

<p class="paragraph"><b>Fig # 35.</b> Configuration dialog for a
new project</p>
</center>
<p class="paragraph">Clicking the <i>OK</i> button, the workspace
will be available to start our project. Our starting point is
always the <i>module Enlightenment</i> and more specifically, the
first frame of animation. Okay, we're ready to <a href=
