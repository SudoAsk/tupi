<p class="title">Added new frames</p>
<p class="paragraph">With our first frame finished, it's time to
add the following. To do this, we will use the <i>Exposure
Table,</i> located right in our <i>workspace.</i><br>
With the mouse, let's press on the # 2 position of the layer # 1,
as shown in the image:</p>

<td><img src="./images/sketching18.png"></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p class="paragraph"><b>Fig #48.</b> Adding a new framework</p>
</center>
<p class="paragraph">Each time we need a new framework to work,
perform the same procedure. It's time to add to our butterfly in a
new position, but first it's time to turn on <i>onion skinning</i>
framework back:</p>

<table>
<tr>

<td><img src="./images/sketching20.png"></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p class="paragraph"><b>Fig #49.</b> Activating Onion</p>
</center>
<p class="paragraph">With this resource, we can use the previous
frame as a guide to where we place objects or characters are
animated. Notice that before activating the <i>onionskin paper,</i>
frame # 2 was completely white? Well, now looks like paper
Transparent</p>

<p class="paragraph"><b>Fig #50.</b> First frame reflected in the
second, thanks to the Onion</p>
</center>
<p class="paragraph">Based on information from the first frame,
redraw the butterfly, this time a little later:</p>
<center><img src="./images/sketching22.png">
<p class="paragraph"><b>Fig #51.</b> Drawing the butterfly in the
second frame</p>
</center>
<p class="paragraph">Okay, now add a third frame, but to give us a
better idea of &#8203;&#8203;how to go about drawing your character
as the animation progresses, we will also enable more visibility of
frames back (10 for this example) in our box <i>Paper</i> control
<i>Onion:</i></p>

</table>
<p class="paragraph"><b>Fig #52.</b> Adding a more and 10 onion
layers back</p>
</center>
<p class="paragraph"><b>Tip:</b> Remember that you can activate the
transparency of both frames forward or backward. Feel free to use
as many as you like, it is important to take advantage of this
functionality to make your animations look as smooth as
possible.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Now we continue with our third frame, exactly
the same steps we took earlier:</p>
<center><img src="./images/sketching25.png">
<p class="paragraph"><b>Fig #53.</b> Drawing the butterfly in
frame # 3</p>
</center>
<p class="paragraph">At this point, chances are you're wondering:
How many frames will need my animation? Well, it's a very good
question to learn how to answer it yourself, with time and lots and
lots of practice. Only with experience will learn to calculate an
approximate value of frameworks for each of your projects. For now,
we will draw as many as needed to meet proposed by our script:</p>

<p class="paragraph"><b>Fig #54.</b> Drawing the butterfly in
frame # 6</p>
</center>
<center><img src="./images/sketching27.png">
<p class="paragraph"><b>Fig #55.</b> Drawing the butterfly in
frame # 9</p>

<p class="paragraph"><b>Fig #56.</b> Screenshots of the frames 21, 31, 45
and 56</p>
</center>
<p class="paragraph"><b>Tip:</b> For this small project was
necessary to draw 73 frames.</p>
<p class="paragraph">One important thing to note is that you should
not expect to draw the last frame in order to visualize how your
animation is running. In fact, it is good practice to review the
results every few frames, so as to ensure that the illustrations
are shaping every second, really correspond to what you have in
mind. <a href="preview_time.html">Let's take a look!</a></p>
