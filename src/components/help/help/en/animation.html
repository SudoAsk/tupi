Here is where you build each frame of your animation to be exact, every line of every character and every piece of the scenario in which you want to tell your story.<br>In other words if, for example, you want to create the animation of a character walking down a street, this tab is where you will design the character and each of the positions in which it will appear as you move: </p> <center> <img src="./images/illustration_shot.png"> <p class="paragraph"> <b>Fig # 13.</b> Animation Interface Module </p> </center> <p class="paragraph"> <b>Tip:</b> Whenever you wish to see the <b>animation module,</b> simply press the <b>Ctrl + 1.</b> <center> <img src="./images/illustration_menu.png"> <p class="paragraph"> <b>Fig # 14.</b> Animation Module Shortcut </p> </center> </p> <p class="paragraph"> In the previous section, we looked at the general components of the interface <b>Tupi.</b> Now let&#39;s look a little more detail to every resource available from this module: </p> <p class="paragraph"> <b>1. </b><b>Workspace/sector =&gt;</b> <p class="paragraph"> Think of the <i>workspace as</i> a blank canvas, the space available for the illustrations of each of the frames that will be part of the animation. There are two rules guide at the top and the left. In the center, has a rectangular white background, symbolizing the dimensions of the frame, or if you prefer your &quot;paper&quot; on the right side we find a dynamic panel that contains the properties of the tool is selected that time and at the bottom, a small set of controls related to the <i>Workspace.</i><br> <b>Tip:</b> That which does not draw into the frame, not visible in the animation. </p> <center> <img src="./images/work_area.png"> <p class="paragraph"> <b>Fig # 15.</b> Workspace/sector =&gt; </p> </center> <p class="paragraph"> <b>2. </b><b>Senior Panel Editing Functions</b> <br> Located in the upper left, the <i>Workspace,</i> this panel offers all the usual basic editing features when working on an illustration: <i>Do, Undo, Copy, Paste, Cut, Delete, Group</i> and <i>Ungroup.</i><br> Additionally, it offers two very useful additional options: a <i>Mesh Guide</i> to Illustrator, which can be activated or deactivated at will and control of <i>onion paper,</i> functionality that allows us to convert the current frame in semi-transparent to see drawings have so much in previous frames, as in subsequent frames. In the &quot; <a href="chapter2.html">Let an example!</a> &quot; delve into the use of the latter. </p> <center> <table> <tr> <td> <img src="./images/edition_panel.png"> </td> <td> <img src="./images/edition_panel_small.png"> </td> </tr> </table> <p class="paragraph"> <b>Fig # 16.</b> Senior Panel Editing Functions </p> </center> <p class="paragraph"> <b>3. </b><b>Tools Panel</b> <br> This panel is located on the left edge of the <i>workspace</i> and provides us with the necessary tools to draw and perform special operations on our illustration. Each resource is grouped by type in the following sub-menus: <ul> <li> Stroke Menu: This menu contains all the drawing tools, including: <i>pencil, Eraser, rectangle, ellipse, line, polyline,</i> the <i>Text</i> option and future <i>tweening</i> functionality.</li> <li> Selection Menu: This menu includes the option of <i>selection of nodes,</i> which can alter the shape and trajectory of a figure from editing of nodes and the option of <i>targeting,</i> which lets you move, rotate or scale any figure is selected from the <i>Workspace.</i></li> <li> Fill Menu: This menu includes tools <i>Fill</i> and <i>Fill Internal Border</i> on selected objects from the color that is defined in the <i>Color Palette</i> at the time.</li> <li> View Menu: This menu contains the option of <i>Lupa,</i> to zoom in or out of the frame that is at issue and the <i>Drag</i> tool (better known as <i>&quot;Hand&quot;),</i> which serves to move the view of a frame when it is expanded.</li> </ul> <center> <table> <tr> <td> <img src="./images/toolbox.png"> </td> <td> <img src="./images/toolbox_small.png"> </td> </tr> </table> <p class="paragraph"> <b>Fig # 17.</b> Tools Panel </p> </center> </p> <p class="paragraph"> <b>4. </b><b>Left Sidebar</b> </p> <p class="paragraph"> <b>Color Palette</b> <br> As its name implies, this is the panel where we choose the color that we want to draw, regardless of shape or form that we are working.

You may want to think about the type of <i>brush</i> tip you&#39;re going to put your pencil. This panel allows us to modify characteristics of the brush, as its thickness, type of edges for the ends of the strokes and the continuity of the line (for example, you can make dotted lines, if you wish). </p> <center> <table> <tr> <td> <img src="./images/brush_properties.png"> </td> <td> <img src="./images/brush_properties_small.png"> </td> </tr> </table> <p class="paragraph"> <b>Fig # 20.</b> Brush Properties </p> </center> <p class="paragraph"> <b>Object Library</b> <br> The function of this component, you can store a copy of the figures or images that are part of our project and we want to reuse in other frames of the same animation or other project.

These fragments are usually easily recognized by changes in the position of the camera or the spectator&#39;s point of view, bone you.<br> Taking this concept clear, easy to describe this component, through this panel we will be able to create and delete each of the scenes that we include in our animation project.<br> <b>Tip:</b> It is important that before you start your animation project, you have very clear which are the scenes that you will develop and in what order you&#39;re going to create.

Through it, you can add or delete new frameworks and new layers to each of your scenes. Moreover, from this panel have the control to select the frames you want to edit in <i>the</i> Workplace from a single click. This functionality combined with the <i>onion skinning Panel editing features,</i> will offer the necessary elements to make your animations look fluid.
