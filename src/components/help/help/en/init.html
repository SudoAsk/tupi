    <p class="title">Animation for Beginners</p>
    <p class="paragraph"> Animation is an art. No. Animation is a fun
      art. We can also say that animation is a technique whereby you
      give life to characters or objects, But the truth is, animation is
      much more than that ... it's miracle! When we talk about
      animation, we look at our start Should by looking at our eyes.
      Nothing miraculous there? Of course, There is ... But, the Ability
      to generate a sense of animation is part of our Ability to see or
      how we see more specifically. Seeing is a science! </p>
    <p class="paragraph"> Imagine that you have a mountain of
      photographs, now begin to imagine that you see them, one by one,
      as fast as possible. Every time you focus on a photo, your eyes
      capture the information and send it to your brain. Your brain in
      turn, converts it into signal that you see. I see a house, I see a
      boat, I see my uncle!, and so on. You might think that means
      seeing just opening your eyes, But each time you "look" at
      anything it takes a great exchange of information enter your eyes
      and your brain, to turn the image into what you receive. This
      process is not easy to perceive because it comes at an extremely
      small space of time, fractions of a second. </p>
    <p class="paragraph"> Now, let's see what happens when you take the
      mountain of photographs and you begin to quickly view them one by
      one: for each image that you place before your eyes, your brain
      begins to make an interpretation of it, however, since each image
      you replacing a new one are, if you do at the right speed, your
      brain is unable to interpret the whole picture and yet to
      interpret the must-begin next image. When the flow of photos is
      large enough and passes at high speed, your brain begins to mix
      the information from an image, with the following and the next,
      creating the sensation of movement, that's when the magic happens
      and we can talk about animation. </p>
    <p class="paragraph"> It is estimated that the human eye is capable
      of up to 24 images distinguishing only if you try to see one after
      another for a second. If the number of images is equal or greater
      than 24, then the eye begins to See that the elements begin to
      acquire motion. wait a minute. does this mean that a film is
      nothing but a huge pile of pictures that pass before my eyes at
      breakneck speed? The short answer is: Yes! However, bear in mind
      we that a movie is something a little more complex, as is
      audio-visual content, which means that also includes sound and a
      lot of technical details for later that leave pending. </p>
    <p class="paragraph"> Wait a minute! Does this mean that a film is

    <p class="paragraph"> In the world of animation, Each compose an
      animation image is that known as "frame", so, the speed with
      projects to film which is measured in frames per second (FPS). The
      more frames you have in an animation, the illusion of movement
      will be much better and the less you have, the sense of flow Will
      erode. </p>
    <p class="paragraph"> Currently, we have a WIDE variety of animation
      techniques, with which we can create content as we see in film and
      video. Here are some techniques: </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>2D Animation:</b> This is a technique based on plans for
        the creation of frames that will be part of the animation.
        Hey!!! wait a moment, what is a plane? When you think of a
        plane, think of it as an uniform surface, similar to a sheet of
        paper, a soccer field, the floor of your house or even think of
        a wall. I know it sounds strange, But a plane is nothing more
        than a flat surface. Now, in terms a little more complicated, a
        plane is a workspace WHERE You have two dimensions to pan, if
        you wish, you can think of these two dimensions as top-down and
        left-right. These two dimensions are those that form the term 2D
        (two dimensions) that people talking about when to use 2D
        animation, incidentally, one of the first techniques of
        animation history. If you look at the edges of a sheet of paper
        and focus on the bottom and at the left edge, you'll notice That
        They are like two straight lines are in the lower That left
        corner. These two straight lines are determined by the level
        those that which you can draw on and technically known as axis
        (in mathematics, calling them often X and Y axis). In short,
        when you think of 2D animation, on a flat surface think made
        from the paths created by an artist or whether on paper from a
        computer program for 2D animation. Two good examples of this
        technique are MOST often used, you can see tv series in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartoon_Network">Cartoon

          Network</a> as well as all the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_Classics">classics

          of the Walt Disney Company Â®</a> . Let's look at another
        example: <br>

        <p class="paragraph"> <b>Fig # 1.</b> Animated Short <b>"Cibertito's

            Crash."</b> Technique: 2D Animation </p>
      </center>
      <li><b>3D Animation:</b> This technique is a bit like the one
        above, except that they talk about no longer two dimensions, But
        three. A simple way of thinking is to think in 3D top-down,
        left-right and front and rear. Therefor, we speak of three axes,
        in mathematics, call the <i>X axis</i> Often, <i>Y axis</i>
        and <i>Z axis).</i> Unlike 2D art, animation in three
        dimensions can only be done through specialized computer
        programs in the field, which is responsible for everything you
        need-to calculating generate Each frame That makes up an
        animation. Under this technique, the creator is not responsible
        for illustrating figures, But rather to model geometric objects
        and then articulated structures so that they can move through
        each frame of the scene under construction. 3D animation is much
        more complex 2D Than because the software focus on the subject
        must perform the calculations' for each point in space, is part
        of each which image. These estimates include: color, lighting
        and texture, among others. All this translates into hundreds of
        thousands of mathematical calculations (sometimes millions!)
        maaaaaaany so work! Fortunately, the computer does it and not
        the animator. The best examples of 3D animation in movies you
        can find are " <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy_story">Toy

          Story</a> , "" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finding_nemo">Finding

          Nemo</a> "and in shorts as" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Buck_Bunny">Big

          Buck Bunny</a>", which we see the scene Following: <br>

            Buck Bunny".</b> Technique: 3D Animation </p>
      </center>
      <li><b>Stop Motion:</b> This technique is based on playing with
        photographs. If you have a camera, is all you need to get
        started! The procedure is very simple, I basically involves
        taking a series of pictures while continuously making a scene on
        small change on the elements. Complex? no, not at all ...
        Consider a simple example! Take a ball or any object you want
        and place it on a table. Place your camera in a fixed position
        in the direction of the table and make sure easily It can not
        move, this point is key for a successful animation effect. Note
        that all the pictures we take, will be captured from the same
        position and angle from the same. Now, take a first shot of the
        original STI ball in position, move in one direction then, But
        only a little and take Another photo again. Move it back a
        little in the same direction you started and take a picture
        again. Repeat this procedure several times until the last
        picture is that of the ball on the edge of the table. Okay, now
        look at the screen of your camera and begins to review all the
        photos from first to last rate according to the same between
        each photo. They'll notice how the feeling perceived that moves
        the ball toward the edge. This is stop motion! Two very good
        examples of the technique of stop motion You Can find in the
        movies " <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpse_Bride">Corpse

          Bride</a> "and" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nightmare_Before_Christmas">The

          Nightmare Before Christmas</a> . " Now let's review an image
        from Another simple example: <br>

    </ul>
    <p class="paragraph"> Okay, Now that we have a little more clearly
      the concept of animation, we'll see what is <b>Tupi!</b> Well,
      our definition is pretty basic: it is free software for the design
      and creation of 2D animation. A project developed by animators,
      for animators and now, in this new stage lives in constant
      evolution.<br>
