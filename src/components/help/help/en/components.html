When you think of <b>Tupi,</b> think of it as a toolbox full of Different components, EACH Designed for a specific task. Now, let&#39;s take a look at Each of the parts That make our work environment, this is the first step you take to start using Must <b>Tupi.</b> </p> <p class="paragraph"> <b>Note:</b> <i>Because we are still in a beta phase of this Development, it is likely That Some options and / or features are modified Within the interface or change of place with home and release, much of the information found in this manual is subject to correction in future versions.</i> </p> <p class="paragraph"> The Following is a typical display of the running application: </p> <center> <img src="./images/tupi_gui.png"> <p class="paragraph"> <b>Fig. 4</b> <b>Tupi</b> &#39;s GUI </p> </center> <p class="paragraph"> Now, let&#39;s take a closer look to ITS components: </p> <center> <p class="paragraph"> <img src="./images/tupi_gui_components.png"> <p class="paragraph"> <b>Fig. 5</b> Diagram of the <b>Tupi</b> &#39;s Components </p> </p></center> <ol> <li class="item"> <b>Top Side Menu:</b> it is the menu Conventional Located at the top side of MOST programs. It is Separated by categories <i>(File, Edit, Insert, Window,</i> and <i>Help Modules),</i> all options of the program. <center> <img src="./images/top_menu.png"> <p class="paragraph"> <b>Fig. 6</b> Top Menu Bar </p> </center> </li> <li class="item"> <b>Panel Basic Functions:</b> is composed of buttons associated with the basic tasks in the file management program such as: Create new project, open existing project, save, save as and close the current project. <center> <img src="./images/basic_panel.png"> <p class="paragraph"> <b>Fig. 7)</b> Basic Function Panel </p> </center> </li> <li class="item"> <b>Work Area:</b> is the main area of application, ie, the space where you design, build and visualize your animations. The work area is comprised of four tabs, each of which contains one of the following modules: <center> <img src="./images/tabs.png"> <p class="paragraph"> <b>Fig. 8</b> Tabs work areas </p> </center> <ul> <li class="item"><b>Animation Module:</b> through its interface, this module will build the graphics of each frame will be contained in your animation. In other words, this module is nothing more than a small vector graphics editor very simple (for now!). </li> <li class="item"><b>Player Module:</b> basically, this is a viewer that can be viewed at any time to give you an idea of how your animation is running. </li> <li class="item"><b>Module Help:</b> This is the module that you are referring precisely at this time. </li> <li class="item"><b>News Module:</b> is a window directly into our account on <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a> . So you can be aware of the latest news on this project, including new releases, the functionality implemented in the development version, news, etc.. <br> </li> </ul> </li> <li class="item"> <b>Left Sidebar: In</b> this component there are three buttons associated with some features of the module shown: <center> <img src="./images/left_bar.png"> <p class="paragraph"> <b>Fig. 9</b> Left Sidebar </p> </center> <ul> <li class="item"> <b>Color Palette:</b> This button displays a panel through which you can choose the color or gradient you want to use when painting with any type of brush. </li> <li class="item"> <b>Brush Properties:</b> This button displays a panel with the current properties of the brush, such as the bulk of it and some characteristics of the stroke. </li> <li class="item"> <b>Object library:</b> This button displays a panel with the object management interface of the library associated with the project. If you have an object or a particular image you want to store and reuse in different frames of your animation, this component will be very useful. <br> </li> </ul> </li> <li class="item"> <b>Sidebar Right:</b> similar to the left, only contains buttons associated with the animation process: <center> <img src="./images/right_bar.png"> <p class="paragraph"> <b>Fig. 10</b> Right Sidebar </p> </center> <ul> <li class="item"> <b>Scene Manager:</b> This button displays a panel that allows the administration of the scenes that make up an animation. Still do not know what a scene? Do not worry, we&#39;ll talk about it later. </li> <li class="item"> <b>Exposure Table:</b> This button displays a panel that displays the table of exposure of each scene. Although it sounds complex, this table is really just a list of frames on which you illustrate your animation. Through this component, you can control the layers and frames of your project. Do you know what a layer? Here is a simple definition: imagine you take a bit of red paint and cover a sheet of paper with the color and let dry, then apply on the same green leaf, waits a while and then apply blue. Although in the end, your paper will look like the last color you used really know that there are other colors below. Think of each of these colors, such as layers, that is, levels of paint define yourself over a frame. Layers are very useful to achieve certain effects and techniques to discover and practice. </li> <li class="item"> <b>Help Manual:</b> This button displays the manual you&#39;re referring to now. <br> </li> </ul> </li> <li class="item"> <b>Bottom Bar:</b> on this region will find a button, this is the option to activate the panel on the <i>Timeline.</i> This tool, well used by animators from other programs, allows you to manage layers and frames, as well as visualize how they unfold the pieces of your animation in real time. <center> <img src="./images/bottom_bar.png"> <p class="paragraph"> <b>Fig # 11.</b> Bottom Bar </p> </center> </li> <li class="item"> <b>Properties Panel:</b> This zone is created temporarily each time you click on one of the buttons are in the sidebars or at the bottom. Although the initial image <b>(Fig. # 5),</b> the panel appears on the right side of the interface, depending on where is the button you choose, may appear on the left side or even in the bottom. If you go back to click on the button initially selected, then the properties panel is closed. <br> </li> <li class="item"> <b>Status Bar:</b> located at the bottom of the program, this bar now only has a mission: to display the coordinates (x, y) where is the mouse cursor as it moves over the <i>work area in</i> the <a href="animation.html"><i>Animation Module</i></a> . <center> <img src="./images/status_bar.png"> <p class="paragraph"> <b>Fig # 12.</b> Status Bar </p> </center> </li> </ol> </body> </html>
