    <p class="title">Let's see how it is Looking</p>
    <p class="paragraph"> Okay, we have half the frames of our project
      completed. It's time to learn to use the <i>animation module.</i>
      Needless to say there is no general rule about how many frames you
      create before making a preview of your project, this is another
      skill that develops from practice, in other words you choose. </p>
    <center>
      <table>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <center><img src="./images/preview01.png"></center>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td> <img src="./images/preview02.png"> </td>
          </tr>

      <p class="paragraph"> <b>Fig #57.</b> Preview the project from
        the Animation Module </p>
    </center>
    <p class="paragraph"> Additionally, note that performing a preview
      of your animation does not affect your project at all, therefore,
      you can access this module as many times as you want, the
      important thing is that an advantage to detect how comfortable you
      feel about the end result and you can correct errors discovered in
      time.<br>
      The preview interface is quite simple, so there is nothing to
      worry about. The <i>Control Panel</i> contains all the necessary
      buttons to play your animation, step by step or continuously. </p>

    <p class="paragraph"> If you look at the bottom of the panel, you
      will find information about the project: <i>Name of the scene,</i>
      the <i>total number of frames</i> and the <i>number of frames
        per second (FPS),</i> this last option is editable and allows
      you to adjust the speed to which you want to play your animation.
      The larger the value, the faster you will see and the smaller the
      number, slower. </p>
    <p class="paragraph"> <b>Tip:</b> The <i>Repeat</i> option is
      quite useful if you have a few frames and you want a more precise
      appreciation of the fluidity of your project. You can activate or
      deactivate it whenever you want. </p>

    <p class="paragraph"> Okay, now it's time to continue drawing new
      frames to meet all of the proposed route in the script. Return to
      the previous section, and ends all pending graphics. It is likely
      that you think is exhausting having to draw the same parts of
      objects or characters over and over again, and we agree with you.
      This is why we are working on a feature called <i>"tweening"</i>,
      used to save a lot of time when you are illustrating.

    <p class="paragraph">Did you finish all the frames you need? Do you like what
      you are seeing in the <i>animation module?</i> Okay, it's time to <a href="video_file.html">create
        your first video file</a>!</p>
