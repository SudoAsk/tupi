It&#39;s time to learn to use the <i>animation module.</i> Needless to say there is no general rule about how many frames you create before making a preview of your project, this is another skill that develops from practice, in other words you choose. </p> <center> <table> <tr> <td> <center><img src="./images/preview01.png"></center> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <img src="./images/preview02.png"> </td> </tr> </table> <p class="paragraph"> <b>Fig # 57.</b> Preview the project from the Animation Module </p> </center> <p class="paragraph"> Additionally, note that performing a preview of your animation does not affect your project at all, therefore, you can access this module as many times as you want, the important thing is that an advantage to detect how comfortable you feel about the end result and you can correct errors discovered in time.<br> The preview interface is quite simple, so there is nothing to worry about. The <i>Control Panel</i> contains all the necessary buttons to play your animation, step by step or continuously. </p> <center> <img src="./images/preview03.png"> <p class="paragraph"> <b>Fig # 58.</b> Control Panel Module Animation </p> </center> <p class="paragraph"> If you look at the bottom of the panel, you will find information about the project: <i>Name of the scene,</i> the <i>total number of frames</i> and the <i>number of frames per second (FPS),</i> this last option is editable and allows you to adjust the speed to which you want to play your animation. The larger the value, the faster you will see and the smaller the number, slower. </p> <p class="paragraph"> <b>Tip:</b> The <i>Repeat</i> option is quite useful if you have a few frames and you want a more precise appreciation of the fluidity of your project. You can activate or deactivate it whenever you want. </p> <center> <img src="./images/preview04.png"> <p class="paragraph"> <b>Fig # 59.</b> Option &quot;Repeat&quot; Module Animation </p> </center> <p class="paragraph"> Okay, now it&#39;s time to continue drawing new frames to meet all of the proposed route in the script. Return to the previous section, and ends all pending graphics. It is likely that you think is exhausting having to draw the same parts of objects or characters over and over again, and we agree with you. This is why we are working on a feature called <i>&quot;tweening&quot;,</i> used to save lots of time when we hope to illustrate that list very soon. </p> <p class="paragraph"> I finished creating all the frames? Like what you see in <i>the animation module?</i> Okay, it&#39;s time to <a href="video_file.html">create your first video file</a> ! </p> </body> </html>
