<p class="title">Help with translations</p>
<p class="paragraph">Due to the constant generation of new
information from our development team and the need to communicate
to the community and in different languages, we decided to make a
particular call to all people with skills to translate text from
one language to another.<br>
Among the types of documents that constantly need to translate
are:</p>
<ul>
<li>News and Announcements from our website</li>
<li>Tutorials, Manuals and Examples</li>
<li>Support Files <b>Tupi</b> language (required for the program
can be used in English, Spanish, Portuguese, Catalan, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p class="paragraph">For news and tutorials, just simply your
desire to help and that you contact us, to tell us that you want
particular text to be translated or if you want to assign one:
always have something to translate.</p>
<p class="paragraph">On the other hand, What is language support?
Simply put, this is the ability of an application to print all
messages in a particular language. If you're interested in
<b>Tupi</b> has support in Chinese, Arabic, French or another
language of your interest, then you're in the right place for
help.<br>
In the case of language support files, you need to have some
knowledge of tools and processes we use to create and manage these
files. Follow the instructions and you can become one of our most
important translators:</p>
<p class="paragraph"><b>1.</b> <b>Learn what <i>linguist</i> and
how it works.</b> First things first, <b>Tupi</b> is a software
application developed with the <i>Qt</i> library, which is written
in <i>C + +.</i> The good news is you do not have to learn
<i>Qt</i> or <i>C + +</i> to help translate.<br>
However, it is important to note that <i>Qt</i> is not only a
library of development, but also includes several additional tools
that facilitate application development. One is a <i>linguist,</i>
a simple program that is included in the installation of <i>Qt</i>
that allows you to create support for new languages
&#8203;&#8203;to <b>Tupi.</b></p>

<p class="paragraph">If you have <i>Qt</i> installed on your
computer, you probably already have installed <i>linguist.</i>
Looking for access to the application on the main menu of your
graphical environment, in the section <i>Programming:</i></p>

<p class="paragraph"><b>Fig # 69.</b> Opening <i>linguist</i></p>
</center>
<p class="paragraph">The raw material of this utility is a file
<b>extension. "Ts",</b> from which you can translate all the
messages that are part of the <b>Tupi</b> language you want. The
good news is that you do not have to start from scratch, because we
already have one ( <a href=
"http://www.maefloresta.com">tupi_es.ts</a> ) on our website.
Download it and rename it according to the language you want
translated. For example, if you want to create support for
<b>Tupi</b> Italian, then rename the file to <i>open it from the
tupi_it.ts and linguist program like this:</i></p>

</center>
<p class="paragraph">Now, let's look at the most important
components of the program, specifically that we will use. The first
is the list of contexts. His name sounds complex, but is nothing
more than a list of groups of words. That is, each list item you
see in the figure simply represents a group of words associated
with that context.</p>
<center><img src="./images/linguist05.png">
<p class="paragraph"><b>Fig # 71.</b> List of contexts</p>
</center>
<p class="paragraph">The next component is the list of words or
messages associated with a context. These messages are appearing in
<b>Tupi</b> and are what we translate. Each context can have a
variable number of messages to be translated. Regardless, all texts
should be translated.</p>
<center><img src="./images/linguist06.png">
<p class="paragraph"><b>Fig # 72.</b> List of words in a
context</p>
</center>
<p class="paragraph">So far, we have located the names of the
groups (contexts) and the list of words for each context. Now,
place the most important tool in the form of translations:</p>
<center><img src="./images/linguist07.png">
<p class="paragraph"><b>Fig # 73.</b> Translation form</p>
</center>
<p class="paragraph">Now let's see in detail what we have to
consider fields in the form of translations:</p>
<center><img src="./images/linguist08.png">
<p class="paragraph"><b>Fig # 74.</b> Translation form in
detail</p>
</center>
<p class="paragraph">Highlighted with <b><font color=
"#A90000">red</font></b> box contains the word that we translate,
in this particular case, the word <i>"Pen".</i> The <b><font color=
"#008400">green</font></b> box contains underlined the space where
we put the translation of the word. In this particular case of
translation into Spanish: <i>"Pencil."</i><br>
Okay, we saw a case in point, now do an overview of the process:
Once you open the file for translation (eg <i>tupi_it.ts),</i> we
select one by one, all contexts <b><font color=
"#157E15">(1).</font></b> For each selected context, we will have
to click on each of the words listed in the second column of the
interface <b><font color="#1D5D8A">(2),</font></b> to translate
from the form located at the bottom <font color=
"#C81818"><b>(3).</b></font> Once we have gone through all the
settings and there are no more words to translate, you have
finished the task.<br></p>

<p class="paragraph">Finally, we must save and send file by mail to
our development team for inclusion in future versions of
<b>Tupi.</b></p>
