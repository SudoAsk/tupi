Therefore, it is Free Software <b>Tupi</b> and everybody is Invited to join this project. </p> <p class="paragraph"> This is the content of our license: </p> <p class="subtitle"> GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE </p> <p class="paragraph"> Version 3, 29 June 2007 </p> <p class="paragraph"> Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt; <a href="http://fsf.org"><b>http://fsf.org/</b></a> &gt; </p> <p class="paragraph"> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, But it is changing not allowed. </p> <p class="subtitle"> Preamble </p> <p class="paragraph"> The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works. </p> <p class="paragraph"> The licenses for software and other Practical MOST works are Designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is to guarantee your freedom Intended to share and change all versions of a program - to make sure it Remains for all STIs free software users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for MOST of our software; it Also Applies to Any other work released this way by ITS authors. Can you apply it to your Programs, too. </p> <p class="paragraph"> When we speak of free software, we are Referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are Designed to make sure That You Have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for if you wish Them) That You Can Receive source code or get it if you want it, That You Can Change the software or use pieces of it in new free Programs, and you know That You Can Do These Things. </p> <p class="paragraph"> To Protect Your Rights, We Need to Prevent Others from denying you rights These Asking you to surrender or the rights. Therefor, if you Have Certain Responsibilities you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: Responsibilities to Respect the freedom of Others. </p> <p class="paragraph"> For example, if you distribute copies of Such a program, whether free or for a fee, you must-pass on to the recipients the Same That You Received freedoms. You Must Make Sure That They, too, receive or dog get the source code. And Show Them You Must These so They Know Their terms rights. </p> <p class="paragraph"> Developers use the GNU GPL That Protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and / or modify it. </p> <p class="paragraph"> For the developers &#39;and authors&#39; protection, the GPL Clearly Explains That There is no warranty for this free software. For Both users &#39;and authors&#39; sake, the GPL Requires That modified versions be Mark as changed, so Their Problems That Will Not Be Attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions. </p> <p class="paragraph"> Some devices are Designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside Them, although the manufacturer can do so. Fundamentally this is incompatible with the AIM of Protecting users&#39; freedom to change the software. The Systematic pattern of abuse Such Occurs in the area of ​​products for Individuals to use, Which is precisely WHERE MOST it is unacceptable. Therefor, We Have Designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for Those products. If Problems Arise Such substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to domains in future versions Those of the GPL, as needed to Protect the freedom of users. </p> <p class="paragraph"> Finally, Every program is Threatened by software patents Constantly. States Should not allow patents to restrict use of software Development and on general-purpose computers, But In Those That do, we wish to Avoid the Danger That special patents Applied to a free program Effectively Could make it proprietary. To Prevent this, the GPL can not be assured patents That Used To render the program non-free. </p> <p class="paragraph"> The required terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. </p> <p class="subtitle"> TERMS AND CONDITIONS </p> <p class="subtitle"> 0.
