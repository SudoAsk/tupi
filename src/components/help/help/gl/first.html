  <p class="title">First things first!</p>

  <p class="paragraph">We&rsquo;re telling a story! You do have a story
  to tell don&rsquo;t you? It&rsquo;s the first step in creating an
  animation project. Usually novices begin to draw on the first
  frame of the <i>Animation Module,</i> without even having the
  slightest and idea of what will happen in the final frame. This
  is definitely not a good strategy for quality results. As with
  any project, animation takes planning. Before you start drawing,
  stop and think for a moment &ldquo;What is my story?&rdquo;</p>

  <p class="paragraph">No matter how small your project, it is
  always worth investing a few minutes to think about the details
  of your animation. Questions like &ldquo;Who are the
  characters?&rdquo; &ldquo;What is the perspective?&rdquo;
  &ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo; &ldquo;Where are they going?&rdquo;
  &ldquo;How many scenes am I going to include?&rdquo; The longer
  your animation, the more care you should take with the answers to
  these questions.</p>

  <p class="paragraph">For professional animators, this planning
  results in what is known as a script, which is nothing more than
  a written text that tells a story which an entire team can
  understand and make into a reality. In this case, it&rsquo;s only
  you, but even though you are the only one who has to understand
  the story, it&rsquo;s still good practice to write out your story
  to organize and prepare yourself and your thoughts for the
  future. When you think about your script&rsquo;s importance, think of
  the importance of plans for an architect or sheet music for a
  musician.</p>

  <p class="paragraph">For our example, we&rsquo;ve deliberately
  chosen something simple, we are going to create a very simple
  animation of a butterfly moving through the scene following a
  trajectory similar to the one in the following image:</p>

  <center>
    <img src="../images/butterfly.png">

    <p class="paragraph"><b>Fig #31.</b> Trajectory of the
    butterfly (basic example)</p>
  </center>

  <p class="paragraph">The butterfly will appear from the left side
  of the screen and disappear off to the right in a matter of a few
  seconds. That is all. Probably you are thinking that this is too
  simple, that perhaps it seems a waste of your time, but do not
  forget, you need to learn how to use the tools before you craft a
  masterpiece. When you have acquired great skill, we hope you&rsquo;ll
  tell us about it and show us the fruits of your labour. It is
  important though not to forget, as an artist, to plan your
  project before you start to draw.<br>

  Good, we now have ready a mini script for our example, so
  <a href="new.html">let&rsquo;s get to work!</a></p>
